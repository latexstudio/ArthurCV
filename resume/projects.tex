        \item{Used OpenStreetMap data and the IO2D visualization library to build a route planner that finds a path between two points on a real-world map}
        \item{Build a Linux system monitor similar to the widely used htop application}
        \item{Optimized a Chatbot using modern C++ memory management techniques}
        \item{Multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map, to manage intersections and facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions}

    {2019} % Date(s)
    {}{} % Location
    {          
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Conceptualized, developed, and tested from scratch an automated, portable autonomous irrigation system with a team of 13 students, leading to successful and efficient water usage for gardening purposes
            \item Designed and prototyped circuit boards using KiCad for data gathering of humidity soil and temperature, optimizing the water irrigation system to save resources and increase yield
            \item Managed the integration between the hardware and software of the product, leading to a fully automated system with minimal human intervention

    {\begin{cvitems}
            \item Trading Bot: Designed and built algo trading bots in python based on the Markowitz portfolio
            \item FreeWay: Re-created the Atari game freeway from scratch, including coding in C, graphics design, and sound design using the Allegro library
            \item RobotVR: Developed an RC car integrated with a VR headset app to transmit real‑time images and controls from a first‑person view 
            \item Created a Python implementation of Visual Microphone using the MATLAB version
